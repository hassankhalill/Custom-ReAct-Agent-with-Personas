BreatheEasy - Your Partner in Healthy, Eco-Friendly Home Cleaning

About Us:
BreatheEasy is a premium home cleaning service dedicated to creating healthier living spaces through eco-friendly and allergen-safe cleaning solutions. Founded in 2023, we recognized a critical gap in the cleaning industry: many traditional cleaning services use harsh chemicals that can trigger allergies, asthma, and other respiratory issues, making homes feel less safe rather than more comfortable.

Our Unique Value Proposition:

Allergy-Safe Protocol: Every member of our cleaning team is trained in our proprietary allergy-safe cleaning methodology. We use only certified non-toxic, hypoallergenic cleaning products that are proven effective without harsh chemicals. Our equipment includes medical-grade HEPA filters and microfiber technology that captures allergens rather than dispersing them.

Full Product Transparency: We believe you have the right to know exactly what's being used in your home. Every product we use is disclosed upfront, with complete ingredient lists available. We partner with leading green chemistry companies and only use products certified by Environmental Working Group (EWG) and EPA Safer Choice.

Health-First Approach: Unlike traditional cleaning services focused solely on appearance, we prioritize your health. Our protocols are developed in consultation with allergists and environmental health experts to ensure maximum allergen reduction and indoor air quality improvement.
